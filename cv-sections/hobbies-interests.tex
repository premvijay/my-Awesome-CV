% \cvsubsection{My philosophy}
% \begin{cvitems}
% \item {Beyond my primary research, I explore with various topics in both natural science and others such as history, politics, technology and sustainable development with a rational viewpoint.
% }
% \end{cvitems}
I do a variety of things but usually they are connected to my strong curiousity, striving to understand each and every thing as I encounter in everyday life. This not only allows me to enjoy the beauty of nature from newer dimensions, I think this is necessary to develop myself and our civilisation as a whole. As a challenge seeking person I also enjoy this process of cracking the puzzles of nature.

\cvsubsection{Reading}
I use the world wide web to explore various topics in both natural science and others such as history, politics, technology and sustainable development, with a rational viewpoint.

 % I explore various topics in science besides my expertise and such as history, politics to  Audiophile, 
\cvsubsection{Exploration} 
I love to ocassionally go for trekking and also travel to experience various cultures and cuisines.

\cvsubsection{Sports}
I love to ocassionally take part in football, badminton, table tennis and swimming. 

\cvsubsection{Other personality}
In my free time, I enjoy doing lots of home experiments driven by my own curiosity. And I can relate with prof. R Feynman that ``Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough". 
I like challenges and I don't like doing simple things repetitively, so I keep exploring various new things. Trying to comprehend the logic behind complex things is my pleasure.
I also love being more self-reliant not because I don't trusts others but simply I am eager to engage in every activity myself.

% I am a foodie, experimental cook, nutritionist, fitness freak, audiophile (also amateur singer), electrical/electronics hobbyist, amateur astronomer and computer gamer.
